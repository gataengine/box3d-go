// SetLengthUnitsPerMeter and GetLengthUnitsPerMeter are implemented in core.go.
//
// Box3D bases all length units on meters, but you may need different units for your game.
// You can set this value to use different units. This should be done at application startup
// and only modified once. Default value is 1.
// Warning: This must be modified before any calls to Box3D

// PORT: macros that depend on b3GetLengthUnitsPerMeter() are functions. The float32
// multiplication happens at run time exactly as in C.

// Huge is B3_HUGE. Used to detect bad values. In float mode positions greater than about 16km
// have precision problems, so 100km is a safe limit.
